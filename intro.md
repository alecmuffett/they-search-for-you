# They Search For You

One of the most useful websites in British politics is
[They Work For You](https://www.theyworkforyou.com) which:

> takes open data from the UK Parliament, and presents it in a way
> that’s easy to follow – for everyone. So now you can check, with
> just a few clicks: are They Working For You?

...but building complex searches for civil society matters, and
accessing such searches in a consistent way (RSS is handy, but
sometimes you want to look something up *right now* and on a mobile
device) can be challenging.

Thus: [They Search For You](.) — curated search for civil society purposes.
