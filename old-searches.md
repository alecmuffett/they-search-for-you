# Trite Expressions

Observation: you don't make something secure, safe, or private "by
design"; instead you create a "threat model" and assess the threats
that your assets or solution faces. Some of those threats may be
externalities - negative impact beyond the immediate scope of your
solution - but those need to be weighed against the positive impacts
and benefits that your solution also offers, plus: there is only so
far you can progress towards mitigating other people's challenges
without negatively impacting *everyone else*.
