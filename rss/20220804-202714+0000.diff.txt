+ Observation: you don't make something secure, safe, or private "by
+ design"; instead you create a "threat model" and assess the threats
+ that your assets or solution faces. Some of those threats may be
+ externalities - negative impact beyond the immediate scope of your
+ solution - but those need to be weighed against the positive impacts
+ and benefits that your solution also offers, plus: there is only so
+ far you can progress towards mitigating other people's problems.
